# Automobile Insurance Risk Analysis

This project explores the relationship between car prices and insurance risk using the [UCI Automobile Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/10/automobile). It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and visual exploratory analysis using Python and pandas, and is structured as part of an academic assignment for COS60008 - Introduction to Data Science at Swinburne University.

## Overview

The analysis aims to challenge the assumption that higher-priced cars always imply higher insurance risk. Key tasks included:
- Cleaning and merging multiple data files
- Handling missing, incorrect, and duplicate values
- Converting qualitative risk ratings
- Visualizing relationships between price, brand, and normalized insurance losses

## Files

- `automobile-risk-analysis-notebook.html`: Jupyter notebook with full Python code
- `automobile-risk-analysis-report.pdf`: PDF report with explanations and results
- `data/`: original dataset

## Tools & Libraries

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- UCI Machine Learning Repository (Automobile dataset)

## Key Findings

- Low-priced cars showed higher normalized losses than high-priced ones.
- Several data quality issues required careful preprocessing.
- Some popular brands (e.g., BMW, Toyota) showed unexpected insurance risk levels, hinting at misjudged underwriting criteria.
